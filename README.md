# A/B Testing and Hypothesis Testing: LinkedIn Premium Subscription and Job Search Success Rate

This repository contains an experimental study designed to analyze the impact of **LinkedIn Premium subscription** on **job search success rate** through **A/B testing** and **hypothesis testing**. Additionally, the study examines the correlation between **networking activity** on LinkedIn and **job success rate**.

## Project Overview

The study aimed to answer the following questions:
1. **Is there a significant association between having a LinkedIn Premium subscription increase a user's job search success rate through LinkedIn?**
2. **Is there a significant association between networking activity on LinkedIn and job success rate?**

### Key Features:
- **Independent Samples T-Test Analysis**: Conducted to compare job success rates between LinkedIn Premium users and non-Premium users.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Evaluated the relationship between networking activity (e.g., connections, messages) and job search success.
- **Tools Used**: IBM SPSS for statistical tests, power analysis and results interpretation.

## Methods and Techniques

1. **Experimental Design:**
   - Designed a **t-test** to compare job success rates between two groups: LinkedIn Premium users and non-Premium users.
   - Defined Job Success as a continuos variable on a Likert Scale varing between No response, connection, r

2. **Statistical Tests:**
   - **T-Test**: Performed to compare means of job success rates between LinkedIn Premium users and non-users.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Used to assess the relationship between networking activity on LinkedIn and job success rates.
   - **Power Analysis**: Ensured the sample size was adequate to detect a statistically significant effect if one exists.

3. **Data Analysis Tools:**
   - **IBM SPSS**: Used for data manipulation, A/B testing, and hypothesis testing.

## Results

- **T-Test Results**: Found a significant difference in job success rates between LinkedIn Premium users and non-users (p-value < 0.05).
- **Correlation Analysis**: A positive correlation was observed between networking activity and job success rate, indicating that higher networking activity may be associated with greater job success.
- **Power Analysis**: Verified that the sample size was adequate to detect an effect with high confidence.
